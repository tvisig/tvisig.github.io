<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
    My name is Tvisi. Pittsburgh native and current San Francisco resident. I'm on a mission to create a more just and equitable world. I'm curious about education, immigration, racial equity, and gender equality, among others.

    I currently work as a Data Analyst at KIPP Northern California Public Schools. I lead projects to improve student attendance, engagement, and student outcomes through data analysis and insights. Most recently, I built out a data visualization on student engagement on Google Classroom. The reports I built, in partnership with several of my teammates, allowed our organization to identify students who were struggling to attend synchronous classes, interact with content online, and complete assignments in a Distance Learning context.

    Outside of work, you can find me at the climbing gym (pre-pandemic), in the mountains, or writing/reading at my favorite coffee shop. I love to adventure and try new things, and cherish the community I've built, both in and outside of the Bay Area.
